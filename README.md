To setup EMR in a different account than Dynamo and S3:

- Run emr_account/emr_sample through Terraform to setup recourses for Tecton to connect to EMR.
- Run dataplane_account/emr_sample through Terraform to setup recourses for Tecton and EMR to connect to Dynamo and S3.

Contact your Tecton rep after these steps are done for next steps.
